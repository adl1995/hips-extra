This directory contains HiPS samples, ie often incomplete version of existing HiPSes, that can be used for various tests without querying HiPS servers.

The 4 following samples, centered on the galactic center, can be used to recreate (in different surveys) figure 4, bottom panel of A&A paper [Hierarchical progressive surveys](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02291.pdf):
* GLIMPSE360: JPG tiles only, equatorial frame
* DSS2Red: JPG and FITS tiles, equatorial frame
* IRAC4: JPG and FITS files, galactic frame
* Planck HFI143: JPG and FITS tiles, galactic frame, tiles with dimension 256x256 pixels
