obs_description      =  AKARI (Previously known as ASTRO-F or IRIS - InfraRed Imaging Surveyor) is the second space mission for infrared astronomy in Japan. AKARI was developed by the members of JAXA/ISAS and collaborators. IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite, launched in 1983 by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands) carried out the first all-sky survey at infrared wavelengths and made a huge impact on astronomy. The AKARI mission was an ambitious plan to make an all-sky survey with much better sensitivity, spatial resolution and wider wavelength coverage than those of IRAS. All-sky survey obtained by the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard the AKARI satellite, at 65um (Color), 90 um (WIDE-S), 140um (WIDE-L),and 160um (N160).
