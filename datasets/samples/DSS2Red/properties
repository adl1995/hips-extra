obs_description      = The Catalogs and Surveys Group of the Space Telescope Science  Institute has digitized the photographic Sky survey plates from the Palomar and UK Schmidt telescopes to produce the "Digitized Sky Survey" (DSS). Each plate covers 6.5 x 6.5 degrees of the sky and have been digitized using a modified PDS microdensitometer.\nDSS2F north is the digitalization of the POSS2/UKSTU Red survey (0.658um)\nDSS2R south is the digitalization of the AAO Red survey (0.64um)\nThe all-sky HEALPix resampling has been done by the CDS
